## Why you might need it
Many PHP developers need to send email from their code. The only PHP function that supports this directly is [`mail()`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php). However, it does not provide any assistance for making use of popular features such as encryption, authentication, HTML messages, and attachments.

Formatting email correctly is surprisingly difficult. There are myriad overlapping (and conflicting) standards, requiring tight adherence to horribly complicated formatting and encoding rules – the vast majority of code that you'll find online that uses the `mail()` function directly is just plain wrong, if not unsafe!

The PHP `mail()` function usually sends via a local mail server, typically fronted by a `sendmail` binary on Linux, BSD, and macOS platforms, however, Windows usually doesn't include a local mail server; PHPMailer's integrated SMTP client allows email sending on all platforms without needing a local mail server. Be aware though, that the `mail()` function should be avoided when possible; it's both faster and [safer](https://exploitbox.io/paper/Pwning-PHP-Mail-Function-For-Fun-And-RCE.html) to use SMTP to localhost.

*Please* don't be tempted to do it yourself – if you don't use PHPMailer, there are many other excellent libraries that
you should look at before rolling your own. Try [SwiftMailer](https://swiftmailer.symfony.com/)
, [Laminas/Mail](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-mail/), [ZetaComponents](https://github.com/zetacomponents/Mail), etc.

Please read [LICENSE](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/LICENSE) for information on the software availability and distribution.

## Installation & loading
PHPMailer is available on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/phpmailer/phpmailer) (using semantic versioning), and installation via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) is the recommended way to install PHPMailer. Just add this line to your `composer.json` file:

```json
"phpmailer/phpmailer": "^6.9.1"
```

or run

```sh
composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
```

Note that the `vendor` folder and the `vendor/autoload.php` script are generated by Composer; they are not part of PHPMailer.

If you want to use XOAUTH2 authentication, you will also need to add a dependency on the `league/oauth2-client` and appropriate service adapters package in your `composer.json`, or take a look at
by @decomplexity's [SendOauth2 wrapper](https://github.com/decomplexity/SendOauth2), especially if you're using Microsoft services.

Alternatively, if you're not using Composer, you
can [download PHPMailer as a zip file](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/archive/master.zip), (note that docs and examples are not included in the zip file), then copy the contents of the PHPMailer folder into one of the `include_path` directories specified in your PHP configuration and load each class file manually:

```php
<?php
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/Exception.php';
require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/PHPMailer.php';
require 'path/to/PHPMailer/src/SMTP.php';
```

If you're not using the `SMTP` class explicitly (you're probably not), you don't need a `use` line for the SMTP class. Even if you're not using exceptions, you do still need to load the `Exception` class as it is used internally.

## Legacy versions
PHPMailer 5.2 (which is compatible with PHP 5.0 — 7.0) is no longer supported, even for security updates. You will find the latest version of 5.2 in the [5.2-stable branch](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/5.2-stable). If you're using PHP 5.5 or later (which you should be), switch to the 6.x releases.

### Upgrading from 5.2
The biggest changes are that source files are now in the `src/` folder, and PHPMailer now declares the namespace `PHPMailer\PHPMailer`. This has several important effects – [read the upgrade guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/UPGRADING.md) for more details.

### Minimal installation
While installing the entire package manually or with Composer is simple, convenient, and reliable, you may want to include only vital files in your project. At the very least you will need [src/PHPMailer.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/PHPMailer.php). If you're using SMTP, you'll need [src/SMTP.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/SMTP.php), and if you're using POP-before SMTP (*very* unlikely!), you'll need [src/POP3.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/POP3.php). You can skip the [language](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/language/) folder if you're not showing errors to users and can make do with English-only errors. If you're using XOAUTH2 you will need [src/OAuth.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/src/OAuth.php) as well as the Composer dependencies for the services you wish to authenticate with. Really, it's much easier to use Composer!

## A Simple Example

```php
<?php
//Import PHPMailer classes into the global namespace
//These must be at the top of your script, not inside a function
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\PHPMailer;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\SMTP;
use PHPMailer\PHPMailer\Exception;

//Load Composer's autoloader
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

//Create an instance; passing `true` enables exceptions
$mail = new PHPMailer(true);

try {
    //Server settings
    $mail->SMTPDebug = SMTP::DEBUG_SERVER;                      //Enable verbose debug output
    $mail->isSMTP();                                            //Send using SMTP
    $mail->Host       = 'smtp.example.com';                     //Set the SMTP server to send through
    $mail->SMTPAuth   = true;                                   //Enable SMTP authentication
    $mail->Username   = 'user@example.com';                     //SMTP username
    $mail->Password   = 'secret';                               //SMTP password
    $mail->SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_SMTPS;            //Enable implicit TLS encryption
    $mail->Port       = 465;                                    //TCP port to connect to; use 587 if you have set `SMTPSecure = PHPMailer::ENCRYPTION_STARTTLS`

    //Recipients
    $mail->setFrom('from@example.com', 'Mailer');
    $mail->addAddress('joe@example.net', 'Joe User');     //Add a recipient
    $mail->addAddress('ellen@example.com');               //Name is optional
    $mail->addReplyTo('info@example.com', 'Information');
    $mail->addCC('cc@example.com');
    $mail->addBCC('bcc@example.com');

    //Attachments
    $mail->addAttachment('/var/tmp/file.tar.gz');         //Add attachments
    $mail->addAttachment('/tmp/image.jpg', 'new.jpg');    //Optional name

    //Content
    $mail->isHTML(true);                                  //Set email format to HTML
    $mail->Subject = 'Here is the subject';
    $mail->Body    = 'This is the HTML message body <b>in bold!</b>';
    $mail->AltBody = 'This is the body in plain text for non-HTML mail clients';

    $mail->send();
    echo 'Message has been sent';
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Message could not be sent. Mailer Error: {$mail->ErrorInfo}";
}
```

You'll find plenty to play with in the [examples](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples) folder, which covers many common scenarios including sending through Gmail, building contact forms, sending to mailing lists, and more.

If you are re-using the instance (e.g. when sending to a mailing list), you may need to clear the recipient list to avoid sending duplicate messages. See [the mailing list example](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/examples/mailing_list.phps) for further guidance.

That's it. You should now be ready to use PHPMailer!

## Localization
PHPMailer defaults to English, but in the [language](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/language/) folder, you'll find many translations for PHPMailer error messages that you may encounter. Their filenames contain [ISO 639-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) language code for the translations, for example `fr` for French. To specify a language, you need to tell PHPMailer which one to use, like this:

```php
//To load the French version
$mail->setLanguage('fr', '/optional/path/to/language/directory/');
```

We welcome corrections and new languages – if you're looking for corrections, run the [Language/TranslationCompletenessTest.php](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/test/Language/TranslationCompletenessTest.php) script in the tests folder and it will show any missing translations.

## Documentation
Start reading at the [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki). If you're having trouble, head for [the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/Troubleshooting) as it's frequently updated.

Examples of how to use PHPMailer for common scenarios can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples) folder. If you're looking for a good starting point, we recommend you start with [the Gmail example](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/examples/gmail.phps).

To reduce PHPMailer's deployed code footprint, examples are not included if you load PHPMailer via Composer or via [GitHub's zip file download](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/archive/master.zip), so you'll need to either clone the git repository or use the above links to get to the examples directly.

Complete generated API documentation is [available online](https://phpmailer.github.io/PHPMailer/).

You can generate complete API-level documentation by running `phpdoc` in the top-level folder, and documentation will appear in the `docs` folder, though you'll need to have [PHPDocumentor](http://www.phpdoc.org) installed. You may find [the unit tests](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/test/PHPMailerTest.php) a good reference for how to do various operations such as encryption.

If the documentation doesn't cover what you need, search the [many questions on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/phpmailer), and before you ask a question about "SMTP Error: Could not connect to SMTP host.", [read the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/wiki/Troubleshooting).

## Tests
[PHPMailer tests](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/test/) use PHPUnit 9, with [a polyfill](https://github.com/Yoast/PHPUnit-Polyfills) to let 9-style tests run on older PHPUnit and PHP versions.

[![Test status](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/actions)

If this isn't passing, is there something you can do to help?

## Security
Please disclose any vulnerabilities found responsibly – report security issues to the maintainers privately.

See [SECURITY](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/tree/master/SECURITY.md) and [PHPMailer's security advisories on GitHub](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/security). 

## Contributing
Please submit bug reports, suggestions, and pull requests to the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/issues).

We're particularly interested in fixing edge cases, expanding test coverage, and updating translations.

If you found a mistake in the docs, or want to add something, go ahead and amend the wiki – anyone can edit it.

If you have git clones from prior to the move to the PHPMailer GitHub organisation, you'll need to update any remote URLs referencing the old GitHub location with a command like this from within your clone:

```sh
git remote set-url upstream https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer.git
```

Please *don't* use the SourceForge or Google Code projects any more; they are obsolete and no longer maintained.

# PHPPdf-Dompdf


[![Build Status](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/actions/workflows/test.yml)
[![Latest Release](https://poser.pugx.org/dompdf/dompdf/v/stable.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/dompdf/dompdf)
[![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/dompdf/dompdf/downloads.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/dompdf/dompdf)
[![License](https://poser.pugx.org/dompdf/dompdf/license.png)](https://packagist.org/packages/dompdf/dompdf)
 
**Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter**

At its heart, dompdf is (mostly) a [CSS 2.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/) compliant
HTML layout and rendering engine written in PHP. It is a style-driven renderer:
it will download and read external stylesheets, inline style tags, and the style
attributes of individual HTML elements. It also supports most presentational
HTML attributes.

*This document applies to the latest stable code which may not reflect the current 
release. For released code please
[navigate to the appropriate tag](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/tags).*

----

**Check out the [demo](http://eclecticgeek.com/dompdf/debug.php) and ask any
question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dompdf) or
in [Discussions](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/discussions).**

Follow us on [![Twitter](http://twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/twitter-a.png)](http://www.twitter.com/dompdf).

   @page rules
 * Supports most presentational HTML 4.0 attributes
 * Supports external stylesheets, either local or through http/ftp (via
   fopen-wrappers)
 * Supports complex tables, including row & column spans, separate & collapsed
   border models, individual cell styling
 * Image support (gif, png (8, 24 and 32 bit with alpha channel), bmp & jpeg)
 * No dependencies on external PDF libraries, thanks to the R&OS PDF class
 * Inline PHP support
 * Basic SVG support (see "Limitations" below)
 
## Requirements

 * PHP version 7.1 or higher
 * DOM extension
 * MBString extension
 * php-font-lib
 * php-svg-lib
 
Note that some required dependencies may have further dependencies 
(notably php-svg-lib requires sabberworm/php-css-parser).

### Recommendations

 * OPcache (OPcache, XCache, APC, etc.): improves performance
 * GD (for image processing)
 * IMagick or GMagick extension: improves image processing performance

Visit the wiki for more information:
https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/wiki/Requirements

## About Fonts & Character Encoding

PDF documents internally support the following fonts: Helvetica, Times-Roman,
Courier, Zapf-Dingbats, & Symbol. These fonts only support Windows ANSI
encoding. In order for a PDF to display characters that are not available in
Windows ANSI, you must supply an external font. Dompdf will embed any referenced
font in the PDF so long as it has been pre-loaded or is accessible to dompdf and
reference in CSS @font-face rules. See the
[font overview](https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/wiki/About-Fonts-and-Character-Encoding)
for more information on how to use fonts.

The [DejaVu TrueType fonts](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/) have been pre-installed
to give dompdf decent Unicode character coverage by default. To use the DejaVu
fonts reference the font in your stylesheet, e.g. `body { font-family: DejaVu
Sans; }` (for DejaVu Sans). The following DejaVu 2.34 fonts are available:
DejaVu Sans, DejaVu Serif, and DejaVu Sans Mono.

## Easy Installation

### Install with composer

To install with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), simply require the
latest version of this package.

```bash
composer require dompdf/dompdf
```

Make sure that the autoload file from Composer is loaded.

```php
// somewhere early in your project's loading, require the Composer autoloader
// see: http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

```

### Download and install

Download a packaged archive of dompdf and extract it into the 
directory where dompdf will reside

 * You can download stable copies of dompdf from
   https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/releases
 * Or download a nightly (the latest, unreleased code) from
   http://eclecticgeek.com/dompdf

Use the packaged release autoloader to load dompdf, libraries,
and helper functions in your PHP:

```php
// include autoloader
require_once 'dompdf/autoload.inc.php';
```

Note: packaged releases are named according using semantic
versioning (_dompdf_MAJOR-MINOR-PATCH.zip_). So the 1.0.0 
release would be dompdf_1-0-0.zip. This is the only download
that includes the autoloader for Dompdf and all its dependencies.

### Install with git

From the command line, switch to the directory where dompdf will
reside and run the following commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf.git
cd dompdf/lib

git clone https://github.com/PhenX/php-font-lib.git php-font-lib
cd php-font-lib
git checkout 0.5.1
cd ..

git clone https://github.com/PhenX/php-svg-lib.git php-svg-lib
cd php-svg-lib
git checkout v0.3.2
cd ..

git clone https://github.com/sabberworm/PHP-CSS-Parser.git php-css-parser
cd php-css-parser
git checkout 8.1.0
```

Require dompdf and it's dependencies in your PHP.
For details see the [autoloader in the utils project](https://github.com/dompdf/utils/blob/master/autoload.inc.php).

## Quick Start

Just pass your HTML in to dompdf and stream the output:

```php
// reference the Dompdf namespace
use Dompdf\Dompdf;

// instantiate and use the dompdf class
$dompdf = new Dompdf();
$dompdf->loadHtml('hello world');

// (Optional) Setup the paper size and orientation
$dompdf->setPaper('A4', 'landscape');

// Render the HTML as PDF
$dompdf->render();

// Output the generated PDF to Browser
$dompdf->stream();
```

### Setting Options

Set options during dompdf instantiation:

```php
use Dompdf\Dompdf;
use Dompdf\Options;

$options = new Options();
$options->set('defaultFont', 'Courier');
$dompdf = new Dompdf($options);
```

or at run time

```php
use Dompdf\Dompdf;

$dompdf = new Dompdf();
$options = $dompdf->getOptions();
$options->setDefaultFont('Courier');
$dompdf->setOptions($options);
```

See [Dompdf\Options](src/Options.php) for a list of available options.

### Resource Reference Requirements

In order to protect potentially sensitive information Dompdf imposes 
restrictions on files referenced from the local file system or the web. 

Files accessed through web-based protocols have the following requirements:
 * The Dompdf option "isRemoteEnabled" must be set to "true"
 * PHP must either have the curl extension enabled or the 
   allow_url_fopen setting set to true
   
Files accessed through the local file system have the following requirement:
 * The file must fall within the path(s) specified for the Dompdf "chroot" option

## Limitations (Known Issues)

 * Table cells are not pageable, meaning a table row must fit on a single page.
 * Elements are rendered on the active page when they are parsed.
 * Embedding "raw" SVG's (`<svg><path...></svg>`) isn't working yet, you need to
   either link to an external SVG file, or use a DataURI like this:
     ```php
     $html = '<img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,' . base64_encode($svg) . '" ...>';
     ```
     Watch https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf/issues/320 for progress
 * Does not support CSS flexbox.
 * Does not support CSS Grid.

**************************************************************************************

Requirements
------------

The following requirements should be met prior to using PHPExcel:
* PHP version 5.2.0 or higher
* PHP extension php_zip enabled *)
* PHP extension php_xml enabled
* PHP extension php_gd2 enabled (if not compiled in)

*) php_zip is only needed by PHPExcel_Reader_Excel2007, PHPExcel_Writer_Excel2007,
   PHPExcel_Reader_OOCalc. In other words, if you need PHPExcel to handle .xlsx or .ods
   files you will need the zip extension, but otherwise not.



Installation instructions
-------------------------

Installation is quite easy: copy the contents of the Classes folder to any location
in your application required.

Example:

If your web root folder is /var/www/ you may want to create a subfolder called
/var/www/Classes/ and copy the files into that folder so you end up with files:

/var/www/Classes/PHPExcel.php
/var/www/Classes/PHPExcel/Calculation.php
/var/www/Classes/PHPExcel/Cell.php
...



Getting started
---------------

A good way to get started is to run some of the tests included in the download.
Copy the "Examples" folder next to your "Classes" folder from above so you end up with:

/var/www/Examples/01simple.php
/var/www/Examples/02types.php
...

Start running the test by pointing your browser to the test scripts:

http://example.com/Examples/01simple.php
http://example.com/Examples/02types.php
...

Note: It may be necessary to modify the include/require statements at the beginning of
each of the test scripts if your "Classes" folder from above is named differently.
